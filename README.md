# Hotel underLOOK

Your one stop access to the important information you need to operate the best hotel in the tri-stae area!

- Trivia data accessed and utilized with a Fetch API, 
- Gameplay implemented using JavaScript classes, subclasses, objects and array prototype methods
- A full testing suite demonstrating the app's test driven development

The game allows three contestants to enter their names, select categories and point values from the gameboard, and answer questions one-by-one accumulating or squandering away their hard earned prize money. The infamous Daily Double and Final Jeopardy make their apperance within the program as instances of extended subclasses of the traditional Turn and Round classes respectively. The entire application is packaged using WebPack, tested with Mocha and Chai, and styled with SCSS.   

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
1. Install the game's dependencies from within the cloned directory:

```bash
npm install
```
1. Let the games begin. 

## Testing

Should you be so inclined to test the program, simply run the test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
